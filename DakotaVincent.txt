Hey everyone this is Dakota!

So I have always been into making stuff and I love to see what people are constantly making and coming up with. I 
love the maker community and would like to interact with it more in an easier format. My idea is to create a website 
where makers can post their pojects and collaborate with one on their projects, or to show off and what they have 
made. My entities will be Users, Collaborations, and Show (where you can show off your latest creations).
